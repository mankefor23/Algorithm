# Algorithm
# Task 1: Write pseudo code that reads two numbers and multiplies them together and print out their product. 
 
Start<br>
Display “Enter the first number”<br>
Read number 1<br>
Display”Enter the second number”<br>
Read number 2<br>
Read number 2 = 9<br>
Read number 6 = 4<br>
Product = number 1* number 2<br>
Print “ The product of”, number 1, “and” number 2, “is”, product<br>
End

# Task 2:  Write pseudo code that tells a user that the number they entered is not a 5 or a 6. 
Start<br>
Display “Enter the number”<br>
If number != 5 and  != 6 then<br>
Display “ The number entered is not a 5 or 6”<br>
Else<br>
Display” the number entered is either a 5 or 6”
End



# Task 3: Write pseudo code that performs the following: Ask a user to enter a number. If the number is between 0 and 10, write the word blue. If the number is between 10 and 20, write the word red. if the number is between 20 and 30, write the word green. If it is any other number, write that it is not a correct color option.

Start<br>
Print “Enter a number”<br>
If number is >=0 and number <=10 then<br>
Print ” blue”<br>
Esle<br>
If number is >10 and number <20 then<br>
Print ”red”<br>
If number is >20 and number <30 then<br>
Print “green”<br>
Esle <br>
Print “Not a correct color option”<br>
End
